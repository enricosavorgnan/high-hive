# TODO File
This file is meant to be a temporary place to jot down any tasks, ideas, or notes related to the project. \
It can be used for tracking bugs, planning features, or noting down any important information that needs to be addressed in the future.

- [ ] Implement basic primitives for hive-bot, but better, such as one hive (done) and ant-movement (only thought, not done).
- [ ] Translate `.PY` code to `.CPP` code for better performance.
- [ ] Start experiment with GNN and RL for Hive AI.
- [ ] Always keep the `README.md` and `todo.md` updated with the latest information about the project.
